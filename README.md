## Introduction
This project documents the integration of a Fischertechnik factory model with AWS services using MQTT communication protocols. The goal is to enable cloud-based control, monitoring, and automation of the factory's operations using Node-RED as the bridge.

## System Architecture Overview
The system uses MQTT to transmit factory data to and from the cloud. Node-RED is the central integration point for managing messaging between AWS IoT Core and the local factory system.

## System Architecture (Temporary Diagram)

> **Note:** This is a temporary diagram representing the current architecture. Final version pending full system completion.

### Architecture Description
- **Factory:**  
  - Executes physical actions and publishes live data such as order status, NFC scans, and stock levels.
- **Node-RED:**  
  - Acts as the local MQTT orchestrator, sending and receiving MQTT messages between AWS and the factory.
- **MQTT Protocol:**  
  - Lightweight communication protocol used for device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging.
- **AWS IoT Core:**  
  - Receives MQTT messages and was used for testing cloud connectivity and message formatting.
- **AWS Lambda & CloudWatch:**  
  - Used for simulation and debugging only. Not integrated with live factory data.

## Factory Metrics and Variables

This section describes the key data points used in the live Node-RED-to-factory implementation.

### üîß MQTT-Based Metrics (Used in Node-RED)

| Metric / Variable     | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `order.type`           | The color of the piece being ordered (`RED`, `BLUE`, `WHITE`). Sent from cloud to factory via `f/o/order`. |
| `order.ts`             | ISO-formatted UTC timestamp when the order was sent (e.g., `"2025-04-29T18:32:10Z"`). |
| `nfcReader`            | Reports detection of piece IDs and states. Each message includes `workpiece.id`, `ts`, and a status like `PLACED` or `REMOVED`. |
| `workpiece.location`   | Factory sends warehouse item positions (e.g., `a1`, `b3`) for cloud tracking after matching with scanned NFC tag. |

### MQTT Topics in Use (Live in Node-RED)

| Topic                   | Direction | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `factory/control`       | Inbound   | Orders sent from AWS to Node-RED (`{ "type": "RED" }`). |
| `f/o/order`             | Outbound  | Formatted order message (type + timestamp) sent to factory. |
| `fl/i/nfc/ds`           | Inbound   | NFC scan result including UID and type from factory. |
| `f/i/stock`             | Inbound   | Full stock list including item IDs and locations. Used to match NFC UIDs. |
| `factory/warehouse/state` | Outbound | Final cloud-published message containing matched `type`, `location`, and `timestamp`. |

## Node-RED Flows and Cloud Messaging

### Flow 1: **AWS-to-Factory Order Flow**  
**Flow Name:** `Ashley_MQTT Factory Control`  
**Purpose:** Allows AWS to trigger factory orders based on color selection.

#### Components:
- **`mqtt in (factory/control)`**: Listens to AWS for an order message (`{ type: "RED" }`).
- **`function (Parse AWS Stock Order)`**: Formats color and adds a timestamp.
- **`switch (Which Color to Order?)`**: Branches logic based on `RED`, `BLUE`, or `WHITE`.
- **`function (Log RED/BLUE/WHITE Order)`**: Logs outgoing order in debug sidebar.
- **`mqtt out (f/o/order)`**: Sends message to the local broker to control the factory.

---

### Flow 2: **Factory-to-AWS Warehouse Flow**  
**Flow Name:** `Ashley_MQTT Cloud Recieve`  
**Purpose:** Correlates NFC scan data with current warehouse stock to track workpiece locations.

#### Components:
- **`mqtt in (fl/i/nfc/ds)`**: Receives the latest scanned UID from the NFC reader.
- **`function (Store Last Scanned UID)`**: Stores UID temporarily for comparison.
- **`mqtt in (f/i/stock)`**: Receives current stock layout from the factory.
- **`function (Match UID and Publish)`**: Matches scanned UID to warehouse item and formats a payload `{ type, location, ts }`.
- **`mqtt out (factory/warehouse/state)`**: Publishes matched result to AWS IoT Core.
- **`debug`**: Displays final cloud message in the debug sidebar.

---

## MQTT Communication Setup

- **Local Testing**:
  - Used a Mosquitto broker to verify basic message sending.
- **AWS IoT Core Integration**:
  - Configured MQTT broker credentials and TLS certificates.
  - Connected AWS topics to Node-RED using secure MQTT input/output nodes.

---

## AWS Integration (Testing Only)

**AWS IoT Core**:
- Created AWS ‚ÄúThings‚Äù with security certificates.
- Used only to verify MQTT connectivity between AWS and Node-RED.

**AWS Lambda**:
- Used for early testing to simulate how factory messages might be processed.
- Not connected to the live factory system.

**AWS CloudWatch**:
- Temporarily used to simulate metric logging and visualize test payloads.
- Not integrated into the live data pipeline.
